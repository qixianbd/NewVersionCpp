This project mainly writen with c++11. 

THREADEXECUTEWITHSEQUENCE.cc
		Create three thread groups, (firstGroup, secondGroup, thirdGroup) and control to make them execute with a particular sequence,
		e.h, 1 --> 2 --> 3. 
		

ComputeMathWithMultithread.cc
		compute the math problem with multithreads.  result = 1^3 + (1^3 + 2^3)  + (1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3) + ... + (1^3 + 2^3 + ... + 100^3)

ComputeMathMT2.cc
		compute the math result with mutithreads: result = 1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + 4 ^3  + 5^3 + .. + n^3    
		each thread computes n/ThreadNumbers numbers values. 
	
	
FlagSweepGCSimulator.cc:
	add testfile FlagSweepGCSimulator.cc to simulate the simplest gc of java. 
	简单的模拟垃圾回收时，　后台线程标记垃圾，　并且定时的进行整理的过程。　
	
	
SimpleBackTimer.cc:
	一个简单的计时器类。　用户可以制定到达多少时间后让后台线程调用某个函数。　目前后台线程只有一个
	The aim of the class is to let the background thread execute the task after a certain time. 
	
ThreadPoolBackTimer:
	ThreadPoolBackTimer, which support more than one background threads. 
	
	
SimplethreadPool.cc:
	A very simple thread pool which can execute the task with no arguments.
